## Horizontal Scrolling (Playbook Cards)

To ensure that the horizontal scroll bar appears for the playbook cards section when the screen size decreases, make sure that the following CSS is applied to the component:

.playbook-cards {
  display: flex;
  overflow-x: auto;
  white-space: nowrap;
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}

This will allow the cards to scroll horizontally when the viewport size is reduced.
